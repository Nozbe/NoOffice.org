## People work to earn money, but are not motivated by it

Yes, I like money as much as the next person, but studies after studies have shown that people are happy if money is not the main reason they do their work. Of course, if you're poor and you're struggling to make ends meet, you mainly work for money. But as the Maslow's pyramid of needs[^1] shows, once people's basic needs are met, they automatically prioritize other things about their work, like relationships, prestige, sense of accomplishment, and achieving their own potential.

## Money is the basic need, and it should be treated as such

I get confused when I see businesses making money more than it is - a basic need. With complicated bonuses schemes, performance metrics and other elaborate *carrot and stick* systems, they think they can trick people into working more by motivating them with money.

The problem with such approach is that once the monetary goal is reached, people lose interest in work that got them there. When it was all about the money, who cares about the quality of work, it's all about getting that bonus, no matter the cost!

> You want people excited about work, not about the money they get from it.

## Let's take the *money talk* out of the table

Talking about money is not fun. Especially when you have to negotiate it. The person who pays wants to pay the least amount possible, and the other side wants to get as much as they can. These are conflicting motivations and very often the outcome doesn't make anyone truly happy.

A few years ago, inspired by other companies[^2], I decided to change that and we introduced a *Salary Formula* - a predictable formula for calculating salaries for everyone on the team.

## Salary Formula - the fair way to compensate for work

Why a formula to calculate salaries?

1. **To be fair to all team members** - a formula like this eliminates individual negotiations and big disparities of salaries between team members which plagues many companies. The formula ensures that everyone is compensated fairly compared to other team members who are doing a similar job.
2. **To make sure the salaries are rising every year** - whatever happens, the components of the formula make sure that every year the salary raises automatically. A person's salary will never be lower than it is today.
3. **To make salaries predictable for everyone** - for each team member this creates a sense of security - they know exactly what they're earning now and how it's calculated and they can estimate how it will go up next year. For the company it's easier to predict cash-flow and budget estimates so that we stay healthy and profitable.

What follows is how we implemented this. It's not a universal formula and many companies approach this differently. This is our way and probably in a few years it's going to be revised. If you're a business owner or a manager in a company, hopefully this serves as an inspiration for you and a good starting point for your kind of formula.

## Components of Nozbe's Salary Formula

The salary formula consists of these components:

### 1. Base salary - the main thing

Base salary is the current market-value salary for each employee category. It's being revised every year based on the market conditions and our company's revenue. It either stays the same or it's going up.

The goal of the team is to work together with an aim to *raise the base* as our revenue increases. This way everyone gets a fair increase in salary at the same time.

> Rising the base salary **is the main goal** we're working towards - to make sure our business is healthier so that we can enjoy higher salaries next year.

There are different employee categories in our team:

- **CXO** - C-executives - we only have CEO and CTO for now
- **VP** - VP (Vice Presidents) like VP Support, VP Finance, VP Marketing, VP Product…
- **Dev** - Engineering team
- **Marketing** - Marketing team
- **Support** - Support team

Everyone from the same category has the same base salary.

### 2. Time with the company (in years, weight: 2 points)

We appreciate loyalty so the longer you work with Nozbe the higher your salary gets. This is revised every year in January and this automatically causes a raise in the overall salary.

Many companies as well as the European Union institutions use this as the main metric for calculating salaries but I don't like it. I appreciate people being a long time with the team, but I don't think that just by being here first, you should earn more than someone who just joined the team but had vast experience and expertise gained somewhere else.

### 3. Level of proficiency (in points, weight: 10)

Level of your professional development as assessed in the moment you're hired. Every team member has a chance to increase this level by learning new skills or improving their current ones, as agreed with their supervisor.

Level is a secondary goal as this is a personal one. It's OK to stay on the same level as long as the job you're doing is great, because your main focus should be to "raise the base" for everyone in your category.

> In our salary formula we stick to this rule: Team first. You second.

### 4. Tags (in points, weight: 5)

Tags are additional responsibilities the person has in the team. Something extra that doesn't directly come from a job description.

For example a person in Customer Support team that also is responsible for some marketing tasks, can get a *Marketing* tag. A front-end developer who's responsible for the Android platform can get a *Platform* tag. Our head of content, Magda, who's my editor of this book, is also coordinating our company-wide things like hiring, so she gets a *Coordination* tag.

Important caveat: VP and CXO level employees who in my company form a "directors" team don't get any tags. This wouldn't make any sense. All of the directors in my company are doing many things and are *wearing lots of hats* so we could literally give ourselves all of the tags.

## The Salary Formula calculated

First we calculate all the parameters against their weight, so we add *time* with the company, personal *level* and then the *tags*:

**Extras** = weight of Time x Time + weight of Level x Level + weight of Tags x Tags

Once we have that, we increase the base salary by these extras:

**Total Salary** = **Base salary for your category** X (1+(**Extras**/100))

### Example Salary Formula calculated

Here's a simple calculation to make the point. Let's say the base is 1000 EUR per month. I know it's low in many markets, but it's the easiest way to show how it's all calculated.

Let's assume the person is 2 years in the team, their level is 3 and they have 1 tag. Based on this, let's calculate the extras to their salary:

Extras = 2 x 2 (time) + 3 x 10 (level) + 1 x 5 (tag) = **39**

Now based on that, let's calculate the wage:

Salary = 1000 EUR x 1,39 = 1390 EUR

### Why teamwork influences the salary more than personal achievements

Let's compare this salary to what happens when we raise the base salary by only 10%.

New Salary = 1100 EUR * 1,39 = 1529 EUR

That's right, the entire salary goes up by 10%, so by 139 EUR!

However, if the person is focused only on their personal development and through hard work they manage to raise their level by 1 point, from 3 to 4 (which is by 33%!), but the base salary stays the same, here's what happens:

Extras = 2 x 2 + 4 x 10 + 1 x 5 = **49**

New Salary = 1000 EUR * 1,49 = 1490 EUR

So yes, they got a nice raise, but the team effort would have paid more.

## Salary Formula takes money off the table when hiring as well

When we hire, we can publish the expected wage for the position very easily. We just put it in the salary formula and vary it by 1 or 2 level points, and we have *wage brackets* done. This is what we can pay for this job. Not more. Not less.

This has made my job easier as the owner of the company:

* When one of my VPs is hiring for a position in their team, they don't have to ask me: *"how much we should pay for this position?"*, they just put it in our salary formula and they have an answer.
* The salary negotiations are no longer a thing we do in the company. We can talk about the personal development level, but not about money.
* I'm not the only one deciding on the shape and form of the *Salary Formula*, I do it with all of our *directors team*. We review the system together and make sure it's fair and square.

## No gender or race bias!

I can't fathom why this is still an issue in 2020. Personally, I have three daughters and I want them in the future to be compensated on the same level as their male peers. The *Salary Formula* doesn't have a gender or race component. Which again, is how it should have always been.

## Downsides of a Salary Formula…

While I believe such salary system is worth introducing in all of the teams, it has its downsides:

* Because of how business works, some people like to negotiate their salaries or believe they're worth more than anyone else. This system is not for them. They won't feel it's fair for them and they'll leave the team or choose simply not to join it in the first place.
* This system makes it virtually impossible to poach people from other companies, as you won't have a leverage of a higher, individually-tailored salary for them. Unless of course they want to work with you because you're following advice from this book and you've created an environment that people really want to be a part of.
* Your competitors will have it easier to poach from you, because they'll be able to individually outbid what you're offering and according to the *Salary Formula*, you have no chance of countering their offer.

While these are valid concerns, I still prefer to work in a team where compensation is not something we talk about too often and instead it's governed by a fair *Salary Formula*. My only concern is to be able to generate enough revenue that I can *raise the base* every year for my team members and that they're paid top money for their work while working in a #NoOffice team.

## The one thing: Let a formula handle the money!

By paying people fair and square and according to a transparent *Salary Formula*, you can focus your team efforts on the job that needs to be done. People will stop wasting time doubting if they're paid enough, if their peers are not earning more or when they should meet their boss for a wage negotiation. A fair and transparent payment system makes for a better team spirit.
