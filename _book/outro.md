## OUTRO. Office is optional

### Office is not the goal - it’s a tool

### Everyone has access to everything from every device

### Flexible working hours

### Trust is better

### Focus is the key

### Office is needed... when it’s needed

### Lifestyle choice

### People judge you for the way you work, not look or act

### Your company is anything you want and the office is not it

### One thing:

- Work is not a place to go, it’s a thing that you do
