## What is the lean way of doing things

The term "lean manufacturing"[^1] was first attributed to Toyota factories. The Japanese carmaker discovered that constantly fixing small problems when building cars resulted in exponential savings in long term.

You might not be building cars. At Nozbe we're just building software. Yet we can still benefit a lot from this insight and we're trying to apply it constantly in the way we do anything in our company.

> Being "lean" means having your eyes constantly open to improvements and seeing where time or resources are wasted. While you're doing something, observing how it can be improved or streamlined or changed altogether. It means to never stop improving everything that you do.

There are two Japanese words that I want you to remember:

**Muda** which means "wastefulness"[^2]. You should be always looking at everything that you and your team is doing that is wasteful. Spending 5 minutes every day on copying and pasting something? Maybe this can be automated. Attending a meeting that doesn't bring value to anyone? Maybe this meeting needs to be questioned or the goal of the meeting can be achieved in a different way? When do you waste time? Where do you waste resources?

**Kaizen** which means "continuous improvement"[^3]. Everything you and your team does can be improved. There's always room for improvement. One fewer click or step. One 5-line function instead of 20 lines of code every time. And the changes don't need to be spectacular - just switching a position of something from left to right sometimes saves seconds and in aggregate minutes per day and hours per week or month.

## Kaizen math - does it really make sense to save seconds?

Our VP of Engineering, Radek[^4], recently explained to our team the "Kaizen math" or how we should look at improving things. He's arguing that before you start improving something, you should look at it this way:

> If you spend **1 hour** on fixing something, that needs improving and by doing that you'll **save 1 minute** a day, just do it.

When it applies to the team, it's even more:

> If you spend **4 hours** on improving something that will save all of the team members 1 minute a day, do it!

This is pretty powerful.

### Why spend 1 whole hour on a small 1-minute improvement?

Because it compounds. You initially save 1 minute, but later you also save much more on NOT being frustrated of losing 1 precious minute of your time... and eventually you might even see additional improvement that will save you another minute... and apart from not wasting lots of time, your work will just feel so much joyful.

### Fixing one thing will sharpen your "improvement saw".

Have you heard of the term "sharpen the saw"?[^5] It means that before using the saw to cut down a tree, you should first spend the time sharpening it to make the cutting more efficient.

That's exactly what happens once you improve something that will make your work easier. You'll be gradually opening your eyes to more "Muda" around you and will more likely be performing "Kaizen" improvements.

You'll eventually start seeing the compound savings of time gained through small incremental changes. Hopefully leading by example you'll motivate everyone around you to do the same. Improving things, streamlining processes and just simplifying stuff can be pretty contagious.

### Improving is not an event, it's a change of mindset

The whole idea of lean is that it's a "way of life". It's not a one-time event, it's a new way to approaching work. Kaizen means "continuous improvement" for a reason, because it's a process that never stops.

> Everything can always be improved. There's always room for improvement. Always.

Having said that, I'll contradict myself in a few moments, because sometimes you do have to start with events to create an improvement mindset.

## How to introduce "lean" to the team?

It's not easy. People are used to doing the things they always used to. You have to be patient. You have to set an example. You have to keep on keepin' on. Here are some tricks we used to start implementing lean.

### Trick 1. Schedule feedback events.

Just as I described at the end of last chapter on deciding, we very often schedule a "lessons-learned meeting" where we are forced to review our past decision and see if there's anything we can improve. When doing this meeting we're forced to think about all the ways things can be done in a better way in the future.

Yes, I know, it's actually a "Kaizen event", something I just said shouldn't be the norm, but through my experience such events teach people to open their eyes to potential improvements. And believe me, people will open their eyes slowly.

And remember each Friday to do your weekly review. It's a natural feedback loop that lets you see your past week and see how you spent it and how much of it was Muda and how next week you can do better.

### Trick 2. Make feedback loops integral part of whatever you do.

Remember the "Pyramid of Communication"? The second level of it is "feedback" and there's a reason for it. This way we make giving feedback to people a "thing we do". And when others give you feedback on your work, they might give you improvement suggestions there. After all, it's easier to suggest improvements to other people's work, not yours.

As mentioned in past chapters, we add comments to tasks, to paragraphs of documents and also we add comments to code, when someone does a "code review" of other programmer's work.

Encourage feedback from others, without it your work will hardly ever improve.

### Trick 3. Automate stuff as much as you can!

Repetitive tasks, copying and pasting, as well as any other mindless work is frustrating. We shouldn't be doing that. Our contribution should be in creative work, not in repetitive chores.

That's why whenever you can, automate stuff:

- Learn scripts on your servers to automate server set up if needed.
- Learn Automator, bash or other ways to automate stuff on your computer
- On iOS there are "Siri Shortcuts" that can really speed up anything repetitive that you do on your iPhone or iPad. When writing this book I had scripts that helped me format each of these chapters and submit them to the NoOffice.org site.
- Many apps or web apps that you're using have automation. There are whole "marketing automation" apps, social media posting apps that can be used extensively to offload your work and do things "in the background"
- There are dedicated web apps to automate stuff between other web apps - and you can do that without any programming knowledge. Just follow simple tutorials.[^6]
- Create templates for projects or tasks. Don't reinvent the wheel but if you're onboarding customers or employees the same way, have a standard "onboarding project template" that you use each time.

### Trick 4. Simplify and reduce the barrier of entry.

As you have seen in previous chapters to this book, we make sure to to simplify things:

- we hold "weekly, but optional" meetings, that are held every week at the same time, in the same virtual room and with the same bunch of people - so it's hard for people to forget about those or about where to go when the meeting takes place
- it's more, each meeting has a calendar entry and in this entry there's the link to the virtual room meeting, so you can join the meeting from calendar to zoom with just one click, it doesn't get easier than that
- personally, I schedule my meals every day at the same time, again it helps me to plan my work when I know when the next break happens
- I also schedule my "focused time" when I want to work on something without distractions. As I know when our meetings take place, I can schedule 2 hours of uninterrupted work easily.

Simplifying things and reducing the barrier of entry in one aspect of team work, opens your eyes to further simplifications and optimizations. It becomes a "thing that you do".

### Trick 5. Show off your improvements.

This is something we need to practice more in our team. Record a short video or screen capture of how you've optimized something or you've reduced the number of steps to getting your task done. Record a short video where you quickly explain what was frustrating, how you went about fixing it and how it works now after you've improved it.

> Basically, show the before and after video. This is the most impactful thing you can do.

## Example of Kaizen in our Customer Support department

Let's finish off this chapter on "lean" with a practical example that you might find helpful.

A little over a year ago I realized that some of the customer support interactions were not up to our standards. This is problematic as we want our customer care to be the best in business. I proposed a weekly review of our support emails with Kaizen in mind.

Every week one of our support reps (each week a different person) would review all past email exchanges with our customers and choose around 10 problematic ones and add them to a report. Then we'd review the report and meet to go over the details - the rep, Iwona (CS department head) and me, the CEO.

We'd analyze each of the cases one by one. The interactions in the report were anonymized so that I wouldn't know who of the customer support reps wrote each email and which customer was affected. We'd not focus on the "who" but on "what happened here" and how can we improve it in the future.

This process was a success, because:

- it started as a "Kaizen event" and started opening the eyes of each customer support rep to potential improvements
- With each meeting as things were improved, they'd have to dig deeper and look for less obvious problems - they were gradually sharpening their "improvement saw".
- As weeks progressed I heard from Iwona, the customer support head, that the whole team felt more motivated than ever to improve their interactions, to find better way of doing things
- The usage of templates skyrocketed. We still respond to people personally but now these responses are more coherent as the rep starts off with a template and then customizes it to the customer's case
- Ideas for improvements stopped coming from the top, but now most of them come from the reps themselves and they are proud of it!

## One thing: Never stop improving!

Introduce lean to your team, being with yourself, look for Muda in the way you work and keep improving things based on Kaizen math. Lead by example and inspire others to always be improving things and you'll have more time for creative work and your job will bring you more joy than ever.
