## Let's get rid of the office and work even better than before!

Almost every business owner on the planet was forced to treat a physical office space as an "optional" thing at some point during 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown.

I deliberately chose to dedicate the first half of this book to *making office work better*. As we reach the second half, I want to show you how all this can be done without a physical office.

After all, an office is just a tool that you may or may not choose to use.

## There is no office – there’s only work

Let's get back to the premise of this book:

> Work is not a place to go; it's a thing that you do!

Ultimately, whether or not you have an office, whether or not your employees work together in-person every day – it's all up to how you, your boss, or your company wants to work. Because having an office is not the goal.

The goal is to do great work.

Or to quote former president of the USA Thomas Jefferson in the *Hamilton* musical:[^1]

> "Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We fought for these ideals – we shouldn't settle for less!"

So let's not settle for working in an office like we *always used to*, but let's re-imagine work. Let's see if we can achieve more personal and organizational happiness by giving people more life and liberty in their work.

## Time for part 2 of #NoOffice – the practical guide to remote work

In the following chapters, I'll expand on the ideas of a modern workplace that I outlined in part 1.

It's all practical knowledge, it’s based on our experience of running Nozbe, an all-remote company, for the last 13 years, as well as examples of other remote-first companies much larger than ours.

Let's leave the office out of the equation and just focus on work.

To do this, however, we need to address the elephant in the room and openly tackle the issue of trust in the workplace.
